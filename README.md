#Title : A Novel Hybrid Load Balancing Method for  Quality of Service in Cloud-Based  Environments

#This study proposes a hybrid load balancing method that combines static Round Robin and dynamic Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to improve QoS in cloud environments. It enables efficient task allocation by starting with static distribution and adapting dynamically based on system performance. Tested through simulation on varied workloads, the hybrid approach shows better response time and resource utilization than standalone methods. The scope also includes future integration with machine learning, deployment on real cloud platforms, and adaptation for energy-efficient and edge computing environments.
